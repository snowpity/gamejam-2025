# Mare Fair's favorite charity is on the verge of collapse!

A disaster leaves the con's fundraising effort short thousands of bits just days before launch. With too little time to find sponsors and too much pride to cancel, Fair Flyer does what she does best, she takes matters into her own hooves. If nopony else can save the charity, she'll organize something that will.

Her solution? A last minute pop-up diner to bring in donations the old-fashioned way.

Matinée and Soirée surprise everypony with their cooking skills, while Morning Mimosa somehow turns improved bartending into a full-on attraction. But as the diner starts to fill with hungry congoers, tensions between the mascots bubble up: old habits clash, tempers rise, burnout looms, and worst of all, hostile reviewers...

If they can hold it together, they might raise enough to save the charity!
